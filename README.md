triage

1- countdown indicator till next night time...

2- -refac fix NPC deployment for night-mode

3- -f sync day and night mode across clients.

ad como key

-dev = develop new features from existing system
-f = create new feature
-i = general idea that might become feature or something developed
-b = bug
-refac = something to refactor

to do

i- opening interior start for spawn. Leads to the spectacular view of the procedural terrain. But how to integrate with randomized spawn points at start? Perhaps the interior is a local, private hallucination, if you will?

b- reduce number of times leaderboard updated?

i- perhaps lore and deeper game narrative revealed by NPCs and, or, artefacts found on the terrain -- perhaps map gives clue to this, revealing a log of e.g. 0/10 secrets found or something? Or a log of narrative fragments.

i- take locomotive fun as a key, perhaps secondary mechanic of the game, esp. since VR (e.g. ATOT web-slinging is fantastic.)

-b players spawn in random radius around official spawn site, to prevent spawning inside other or stationary models.

-f 2d map showing locations of all clients; dynamically zoom out to fit all in? Or, allow client to zoom as they wish.
-i clients can bookmark certain locations, recorded onto their 2D map and which also records their journey in each session; this can be downloaded as a .txt file or, better, a pdf image.

-b fuse fix for when on mobile. Seems to remain on.

-refac vibes panel should look like menu button -- bevelled

-f vibehouse portal

-refac move vibeverse portal to top of mountain near spawn, and hide until client has collected 64 vibes. OK -- not hide, but lock, Quake style, until client has collected the 64 vibes.

-f instructions about vibes and portal and vibeHouse on welcome message

-f cublit's steal vibes for energy (descend over top of client's head)

-sync projectiles and npcs and collectibles

-refac vibes worth 5; rings 1; karpathy crystals 1;

-refac vibes different blue, or black; rings smaller
-f sonic rings generate in 'runs'

-f glasts swarm view (no harm)



-f countdown indicator till next night time...

-dev projectile pulse (light kick to other players and npcs)

-b vibes specials need to accumulate time, not reset due to set timeout from first vibe collected

-dev woods in only certain areas; option to decide manually as well as 'background' deployment of wooded areas from world seed.

-b pulse kick to other players not working...

-b leaderboard does not sync across clients.

-b Sync features like collectibles and NPCs. And projectiles. Well, that is, projectile events? Vibe best solution.

-f 'house' to enter vibehouse.gwendall.com by @gwendall

-f sync night mode across clients.

-f quake style portal effect

-f asteroid showers

-f rain

-b night and day mode npcs -- with correct swarming of clients

DONE-dev leaderboard vibes (distance travelled?)

DONE-refac simplified collectibles (plus sounds/textures)

DONE-bVR mode freezes when tilting right: refs commented out minihub?

DONE-i optimize more fully in anticipation of less capable machines

DONE -dev performance version of terrain (if time, pooling of terrain chunks, cf. NPCs)

-f bioluminescent mushrooms and, or, will 'o the wisps.

DONE-i just one track for entire game (to keep lightweight). OK, maybe three -- since we have ambient and a lyrical.

DONE-i ambient music track: is there a term for music that does not exhaust the ear, but whose melodies and other properties find themselves welcome and even addicting for the listener?
[Yes - fatigue.]

DONE-refac adjust positions and possibly colours of ui buttons (music and menu) - i.e. out of way of and in line with other elements.

-refac port music button to menu

DONE-refac temporary 'fix' -- remove miniHud

DONE-refac remove micro-hud as visible in default. Perhaps 'port' to menu
have commented out in a-loco.js. Also will comment out or hide in index.html

DONE-f metavibe portal

DONE-f avatars

-f dome-like rocks or plant 'bulbs', on pattern of grass instancing

-f modular articulated 'serpents'. Cf. worms of Dune. 

-i huge quarry machines and loader vehicles hauling off mysterious cubes with numbers on them (secret: farming the digits of pi 'for use in the human world -- all numbers are created here'); other ideas, naming clients after Mathematicians and mathematical concepts; quarry of prime numbers?

DONE-i collectibles called 'vibes' and the 'kaparthy diamond', the latter where subjects can choose a behaviour to happen to all other (or targeted?) subjects by avatar name, such as floating them upward to a certain height, then dropping; or all mobs swarming, etc.
-i+ every 1 minute a new kaparthy dropped ('shipped'); then, if collected, this client has 5seconds to use, else start 1min wait again.

DONE-f gamemode -- event triggers or just timed, 'night time' when sky goes dark and perhaps the more disturbing mobs appear

DONE-f headlights [TORCH AT NIGHT]

DONE-f clouds

DONE-refac desktop mouselook DONE

DONE-f opening message for controls and goal

DONE-f simple mobile button for locomotion 

DONE-f button to access menu on mobile

DONE-f music

DONE-f sound effects

DONE-dev pool terrain chunks

DONE -dev pool npcs

DONE-feature randomized names

-f view other players (must include ability to view VR client)

-f jump with space (menu some other button - Enter?)

-f sensitivity to gradients -- for sliding and climb-labour

-b reinstate pitch of npcs

-b mobs emerge from under terrain (avoids sudden appearance)

DONE-b npc spawning DONE

-b npc spawning and states - refine this.
